# Library Phase Four
This assignment was part of my software development apprenticeship program. It is the fourth part of a multi-phase project in which I created a full-stack library application.

## Overview
Phase IV of the library project focused on the back-end of the application. In this phase I used Express and Node.js to build end points that interact with the Google Firestore database on Google Cloud Platform.  This phase also allowed me to incorporate authentication through the use of JSON Web Tokens.
